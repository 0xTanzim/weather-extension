# OpenWeather API Keys (comma-separated for round-robin rotation)
# You can use either single key or multiple keys
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEYS=your_first_api_key_here,your_second_api_key_here,your_third_api_key_here

# OR use a single key (fallback)
# OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_single_api_key_here

# Example with multiple keys:
# OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEYS=abc123def456,xyz789uvw012,def345ghi678

# The system will automatically rotate between keys for better performance
# and to avoid rate limits. Keys with too many errors will be temporarily
# deactivated and reactivated later.
